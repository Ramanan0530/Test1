  The Visual Studio Code for Education team is excited that you are here and
  ready to create your own lessons using our latest feature - Authoring.
  Authoring is currently in Beta, which means we’re actively developing and
  improving this feature. We would love your thoughts by selecting “Give
  Feedback” or joining our Community to share ideas, report issues, and help
  shape the future of Authoring and VS Code for Education.


  **Happy writing!**


  ## Getting Startdsds


  This template helps you set up your first lesson. In this panel, located on
  the right side of the screen, you’ll find our built‐in WYSIWYG content editor,
  where you can type, copy/paste, format text, and embed code or images.


  To the left of this panel, you can choose which interface elements learners
  have access to such as the Terminal, Editor, and Explorer. By default, your
  lesson content is displayed for learners.


  ### Ready to dive in?


  If you already know your way around, remove this “Let’s get started!” tutorial
  lesson using the trash can icon in the Table of Contents. We’ve also created a
  placeholder lesson with the title you provided—just click to begin
  customizing.
